# Tool Installation
* vscode
  * https://code.visualstudio.com/download
  * Could also be installed from https://my.visualstudio.com but it is an open source tool and should be identical
* PuTTY
  * Download from https://www.putty.org/
  * Very standard and reliable, good to have and learn to use even when there are better alternatives.
  * There are other PuTTY tools out there our team uses:
    * Solar PuTTY: https://www.solarwinds.com/free*tools/solar*putty
      * Nolan recommended this! Browser*like interface. Tabs and more intuitive session grouping and UI.
    * MTPUTTY (Multi*Tabbed PuTTY): https://ttyplus.com/multi*tabbed*putty/
      * Jyothsna recommended this! Similar to PuTTY but with better tabbing support.
  * Sometimes I use PuTTY, but I mostly ssh from a local terminal to my remote instance. On windows, I use
    WSL2 and tmux for this.
* WinSCP: Download from https://winscp.net/eng/index.php

* WSL2 (personal, non*conventional)
  * installed by following instructions here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en*us/windows/wsl/install*win10
  * why?
    * I can't say this is necessary for remote development or our teammates, but it has 
      a lot of pros which is why I install it on my windows machines for local development and tools.
    * this is a lightweight local linux VM that has access to windows executables and the file system.
    * A good substitute for putty, WinSCP, etc: With ssh, scp, sftp, and other utilites readily available. 
    * I personally use it to provide me with linux tools in my windows machine. It can interact with my
      local vscode and is a better environment for python scripting amongst other things.
    * Because it is readily integrated with the windows filesystem, I have automation tools such as windows
      notifications and reminders based on bash/python scripts.
    * With tmux, I can also efficiently navigate between my local and remote VM environments. 
      * tmux allows you to nest tmux servers. This means that I can organize local & remote sessions and
        preserve progress on both my local and remote environment.
   * I will have to follow up on some of the issues I raised IT tickets for (mostly certificate problems)
* tmux, vim, git, curl, python3, etc: Provided with WSL2
* I have my own plugins for vim, tmux, vscode, etc but I will need to make dedicated tutorials for these.
